Exercise: Background Generator

Using the 3 exercise files provided here are a few things you can try:

1. Write code so that the colour inputs match the background generated on the first page load. 
2. Display the initial CSS linear gradient property on page load.
3. BONUS: Add a random button which generates two random numbers for the colour inputs.

You may also see different behaviours with the Color widget based on what browser you use. Remember, all browsers are implemented differently. 

Good luck!
